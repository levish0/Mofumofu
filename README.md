# 🐟 Tuna

> A minimalist social network: no tracking, no distractions.

Today’s social networks collect, use, and sell your data.  
We stand firmly against that.

As an open-source project, Tuna does **not** collect or use your information.  
There are no algorithms manipulating your feed, and some conveniences may be missing,  
but if you can accept that, we can all enjoy a safer, more honest internet experience together.

Simplicity is not a step back, it’s a way forward.  
Tuna believes in honest, untracked expression — no algorithms, no data selling, no distractions.  
A social network where your thoughts and images speak for themselves.
