# 📝 Textura

> A minimalist social network: no photos, no distractions, just honest words.

The internet today is overflowing with stimulation,  
short-form videos, endless scrolls, and media designed to grab attention.

In the midst of this noise, we often forget the quiet power of simple words.

**Textura** is a space to return to that simplicity.  
No photos. No videos. No filters.

Just your thoughts, written plainly and shared honestly.

And maybe, someone will like them,  
not for how they look, but for what they say.

## 🤍 Philosophy

Simplicity is not a step back, it’s a way forward.  
Textura believes in the value of words, unfiltered and unpolished.  
A social network where you’re not the content, your thoughts are.
